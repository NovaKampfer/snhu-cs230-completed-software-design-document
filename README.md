The Gaming Room – Software Design Document Reflection

1. Client and Requirements
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, into a multi-platform application. The software needed to handle multiple game instances, each with unique teams and players, while ensuring efficient memory and storage management across platforms.

2. Strengths in Documentation
I did particularly well in clearly explaining the technical strategies for memory and storage management, and in making the document understandable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

3. Helpful Aspects of the Process
Working through the design document helped me fully understand the project requirements before writing code. It clarified how different design choices impact performance, scalability, and security.

4. Possible Revisions
If I revised the document, I would expand the scalability and architecture section with more diagrams and use-case examples to make the concepts even clearer.

5. Meeting the User’s Needs
I translated the user’s needs into technical specifications by focusing on performance, user experience, and cross-platform compatibility. Considering user needs is critical to ensuring the software is functional, accessible, and enjoyable.

6. Approach to Software Design
I approached the design by gathering requirements, researching platform capabilities, and selecting architecture that balanced performance, scalability, and maintainability. In future projects, I would continue using this approach and also incorporate more stakeholder feedback earlier in the design process.
